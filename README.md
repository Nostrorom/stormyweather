## What is this repo ? 

It started as a job application for an open position at Tailwind, that I named Highseas. I ran short of time to properly do all what I wanted, so I made a copy to continue my work.

It has now evolved into a personal project in this repo called Sotrmyweather. Yeah, I'm not one to let go of a good sailing metaphor ;) 

It's now both a sandbox to practise the tools, and an end-result offering thoughts on them, mainly Tailwind to start with.

### Tools

This is built with:

* Svelte + Sapper
* Tailwindcss

I'll be updating it with a data visualization tool, probably one of: 

* D3js
* Chartjs
